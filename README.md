Machine Learning - Introduction 
Part 1: Machine Learning - Introduction
Welcome to the first part of the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning module.
In this section, you'll begin your journey into machine learning and train your first models.

Donâ€™t just follow the subject blindlyâ€”strive to understand the tools you're using.
Read the documentation, and be prepared to explain:

What each step does
Why itâ€™s important
The advantages and limitations of each tool
What is Machine Learning?
Machine learning is a branch of computer science focused on building systems that learn from data.
Rather than following fixed rules like traditional programs, ML models uncover hidden patterns in datasets to make predictions or decisions.

Research Topics
Before getting started do your research on machine learning and be able to at least answer the following questions:

What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?
What are types of supervised learning?
Whatâ€™s the difference between classification and regression? What output does each produce?
How do you determine whether a problem is classification or regression?
Are there ML problems that fall outside classification and regression?
What is skewed data and how to mitigate it's effect?
Predicting Bike Sharing Demand
Explore the dataset to understand distributions, correlations, and feature relationships.
Use appropriate plots and explain your choicesâ€”why you chose that graph, and what alternatives exist.

Prepare:
Gain insights from the data through exploration.
Clean and adjust the data as necessary.
Build a preprocessing pipeline using scikit-learn.
Wrap the pipeline creation into a reusable function that accepts any estimator.
Model Training
Train models to predict hourly bike rentals using:

LinearRegression
RandomForestRegressor
XGBRegressor
GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning
Evaluate your models using multiple performance metrics.

Dataset
Download the dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository:
